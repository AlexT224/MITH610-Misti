<head>Reaction Strong to Wallace</head>
<p>By DIANA MCGEE &amp; DON BURROWS</p>
<p>In response to the question ”What did you th­ink of <persName>Governor Wallace’s</persName> speech?” the students’ answers were as mixed and
  varied as was the audience in Cole Field House Tuesday evening.</p>

<p><persName>Robert Hill</persName>, an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said, <quote><positive>I think he was great. I wish I could meet him. I believe he is for what America
  stands for.</positive></quote></p>

<p><persName>David Boston</persName>, also an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>fresh­man</roleName>, felt that <quote>... <negative>he is a very poor excuse for an American. If democracy is so
weak as to accept the principles he proposed, it won’t be long until democracy disappears completely.</negative></quote></p>

<p><persName>Ernest Kopp</persName>, a <roleName>junior</roleName> in <orgName>Engineering</orgName> said, <quote><positive>I think he really answered the questions bluntly and truthfully,</positive></quote> while David Cole,
an Education junior said, <quote><negative>I think he twisted and evaded most questions.</negative></quote></p>

<p><persName>Diane Holeman</persName>, a <orgName>BPA</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName> said, <quote><negative>I thought he was rather pessimistic and had for­gotten the four children who died in the
church.</negative></quote></p>

<p><persName>Ronald Jones</persName>, an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName>, said, <quote><negative>I think that his speech was very superficial. He didn’t go deeply into any point
The appeal of his speech is the lower, unthinking class.</negative></quote></p>

<p><persName>David Beardmore</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said, <quote><positive>I thought he did a good job of presenting his case. It is a case of state’s rights,
not the Negro problem. Many people misinterpret the problem.</positive></quote></p>

<p><persName>Carolle Foley</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName>, felt <quote><negative>He was too stupid for words,</negative></quote> while <persName>Jim Lawrence</persName>,
an <orgName>Engineering</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said,<quote><positive>He’s great, great. He’s for state’s rights.</positive></quote></p>

<p><orgName>BPA</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName>, <persName>Jim Coll</persName> said, <quote><positive>I thought he was really good. He had a lot of facts be­hind what he said,</positive></quote>
 while <persName>Charles Zitzoff</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName> felt, <quote><positive>He was a very eloquent speaker</positive>, <negative>but he was a flimflam artist.</negative></quote></p>

<p><persName>James Bohar</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp; S</orgName> <roleName>senior</roleName> said, <quote><transform>When I went in, I was dead set against him, but now I
feel more positive toward him.</transform> <neutral>He confused state’s rights with the integration issue.</neutral></quote></p>

<p><persName>Ed Bell</persName>, a <orgName>BPA</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName> said, <quote><neutral>It was interesting. I came to hear what he had to say. Some of it sounded rational and some
  of it was idiotic.</neutral></quote></p>

<p><persName>Skip Collins</persName>, an <orgName>A &amp;S</orgName> <roleName>junior</roleName> stated, <quote><negative>I thought he was giving very weak retorts. He appealed mainly to emotion. It was
  very obvious that he was predjudiced.</negative></quote></p>

<p>An <orgName>Industrial Education</orgName> <roleName>sophomore</roleName>, <persName>Ernest Stanley</persName>, said, <quote><neutral>It’s the same thing over and over. I even read some of it in the
  Tuesday’s Diamond­back.</neutral></quote></p>

<p>One <roleName>freshman</roleName> co-ed, who refused to be identified, said, <quote><neutral>I just wish that everyone would have let him say what he wanted
without in­terrupting.</neutral></quote></p>

<p><persName>Felecia Hegamonnley</persName>, an <orgName>Education</orgName> <roleName>freshman</roleName> said, <quote><negative>I don’t like him too much. He’s not good­ looking.</negative></quote></p>
