In response to the question” What did you th­ink of Governor Wallace’s speech?” the students’ answers were as mixed and varied as was the audience in Cole Field House Tuesday evening.

Robert Hill, an Engineering freshman said, "I think he was great I wish I could meet him. I believe he is for what America stands for.”

David Boston, also an Engineering fresh­man, felt that "... he is a very poor excuse for an American. If democracy is so weak as to accept the principles he proposed, it won’t be long until democracy disappears completely.”

Ernest Kopp, a junior in Engineering said, "I think he really answered the questions bluntly and truthfully,” while David Cole, an Education
junior said, "I think he twisted and evaded most questions.”

Diane Holeman, a BPA sophomore said, "I thought he was rather pessimistic and had for­
gotten the four children who died in the church.”

Ronald Jones, an Engineering freshman, said, "I think that his speech was very superficial. He didn’t go deeply into any point The appeal of his speech is the lower, unthinking class.”

David Beardmore, an A & S freshman said, "I thought he did a good job of presenting his
case. It is a case of state’s rights, not the Negro
problem. Many people misinterpret the problem.”

Carolle Foley, an A & S sophomore, felt "He was too stupid for words,” while Jim Lawrence,
an Engineering freshman said," He’s great, great. He’s for state’s rights.”

BPA sophomore, Jim Coll said, "I thought he was really good. He had a lot of facts be­
hind what he said,” while Charles Zitzoff, an A & S sophomore felt, "He was a very eloquent speaker, but he was a flimflam artist”

James Bohar, an A & S senior said, "When I went in, I was dead set against him, but now I
feel more positive toward him. He confused state’s rights with the integration issue.”

Ed Bell, a BPA sophomore said, "It was interesting. I came to hear what he had to say. Some of it sounded rational and some of it was idiotic.” '

Skip Collins, an A&S junior stated, "I thought he was giving very weak retorts. He appealed mainly to emotion. It was very obvious that he was predjudiced.”

An Industrial Education sophomore, Ernest Stanley, said, " It’s the same thing over and over. I even read some of it in the Tuesday’s Diamond­back.”

One freshman co-ed, who refused to be
identified, said, "I just wish that everyone would have let him say what he wanted without in­terrupting.”

Felecia Hegamonnley, an Education freshman said, "I don’t like him too much. He’s not good­ looking.”
